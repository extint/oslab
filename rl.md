Inspired by the classic game Super Mario Bros, Super MaRLo Bros is an exciting project that combines game development and artificial intelligence. You'll build the game from scratch using PyGame and then train the computer to navigate and succeed in it using Reinforcement Learning. You have to teach the computer to play the game you made. We'll experiment with different RL algorithms, learning how they work and which ones are most effective as we go along the project. This project is perfect for anyone interested in game development and artificial intelligence.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that trains software to make optimal decisions through trial and error. RL algorithms use a reward-and-punishment system to process data. Actions that help achieve the goal are reinforced, while others are ignored.

By the end, you'll have a fully functional game and an AI-based smart computer player! No need to get overwhelmed, it only needs your interest!
